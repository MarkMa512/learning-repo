# Git Cheat sheet

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. `git clone <repository>`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

3. `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area, preparing it for commit.

4. `git commit -m "message"`: Records the changes made to the staged files and creates a new commit with a descriptive message.

5. `git status`: Shows the current state of the repository, including modified, staged, and untracked files.

6. `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

7. `git push`: Sends the committed changes to a remote repository.

8. `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository or creates a new branch.

9. `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a different branch or restores files from a specific commit.

10. `git merge <branch>`: Integrates changes from one branch into another.

11. `git fetch`: Retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository **without merging them**.

12. `git log`: Displays the commit history in chronological order.

13. `git remote`: Manages connections to remote repositories.

14. `git diff`: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area or between different commits.

15. `git reset`: Unstages files or moves the HEAD and current branch to a different commit.

16. `git rebase <branch>`: integrate changes from one branch onto another branch by applying each commit from the source branch onto the target branch. `<branch>` is the branch from which you want to apply the commits.
