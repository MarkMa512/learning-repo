## Types of Memory and Storage 
- Memory: 
  - Volatile: 
    - RAM: Random Access Memory 
        - SRAM: Static RAM; faster, more expensive, less dense than DRAM
            - CPU Cache
                - L1 Cache
                - L2 Cache
                - L3 Cache
        - DRAM: Dynamic RAM
            - FPM DRAM
            - EDO DRAM
            - SDRAM
                - DDR SDRAM
                    - DDR4 SDRAM
                    - DDR5 SDRAM
                - GDDR SDRAM 
                    - GDDR6 SDRAM
  - Non-Volatile
    - ROM: Read Only Memory
        - Firmware: software that is embedded in a hardware device that defines how the device interacts with the world / with other devices connected to it
            - BIOS: Basic Input Output System\
                * First software run by a computer when powered on, initializes hardware, boots OS
            - UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface 
- Storage 
    - HDD: Hard Disk Drive
        * Introduced by IBM in 1956 
        * Spinning platters, magnetic coating, read/write heads 
        * Large capacity, low cost, slow speed
    - SSD: Solid State Drive
        * Introduced by SanDisk in 1991
        * Uses NAND-based flash memory
        * High speed, low capacity, high cost
        * faster data access, lower power consumption, less noise, less heat, more reliable / higher durability 
        - NVME: Non-Volatile Memory Express
            * Protocol for accessing high-speed storage media
            * Uses PCIe bus
            * Faster than SATA
            * Lower latency
            * Higher IOPS
            * Lower power consumption
            * Higher throughput
    - USB Drive 
        * Small plug-and-play portable storage device
    - SD Card: Secure Digital Card
        * Come in 3 sizes: standard, mini, micro 
        * Used in digital cameras, smartphones, tablets, etc.
