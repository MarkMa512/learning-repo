DNS: Domain Name System

## How does DNS work? 

DNS is a distributed database that maps domain names to IP addresses. 

## Authoritative DNS 

3 Levels of DNS:

1. The Top Level Domain (TLD) servers are responsible for top-level domains like .com, .org, .net, etc.
2. The Authoritative DNS servers are responsible for knowing everything about a specific domain, including all of the IP addresses of the web servers that store the domainâ€™s content. 
3. The Recursive DNS servers are responsible for providing the IP addresses of the authoritative DNS servers.
