# Java 
Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, high-level programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is related in some ways to C and C++, in particular with regard to its syntax, and borrows a few ideas from other languages. Java applications are compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is designed to be simple enough that many programmers can quickly become proficient in the language. It is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 10 million users.
