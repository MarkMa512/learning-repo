## OOP Concepts

### Abstraction 
Defining a class with only the essential attributes and methods while ignoring non-essential attributes and methods. 

### Encapsulation
Seperate components into external and internal components. External components are the public methods and attributes that are exposed to the user. Internal components are the private methods and attributes that are hidden from the user.

### Modularity 
Breaking up a program into smaller, more manageable pieces. 

#### Functional Decomposition
Breaking up a program into smaller, more manageable pieces based on functionality.

#### Object-Oriented Decomposition
Breaking up a program into smaller, more manageable pieces based on objects. 

### Hierarchy 
Ranking objects based on their level of abstraction. 

### Inheritance 
Inheriting attributes and methods from a parent class.

### Polymorphism  
The ability to take on many forms. 


## Java Data Types

### Primitive Data Types

| Data Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| byte | 1 byte | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 |
| short | 2 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 4 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long | 8 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float | 4 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits |
| double | 8 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits |
| boolean | 1 bit | Stores true or false values |
| char | 2 bytes | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values |

### Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
